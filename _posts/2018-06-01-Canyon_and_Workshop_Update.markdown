It's been a while. A long while. Anyways, I felt like updating the blog. Here's some stuff about the just released canyon & workshop update.

Here's the trailer, which turned out pretty cool:

So yeah, GunHero has Steam Workshop support now and the update also adds 25 new canyon-themed challenging levels to the campaign.

Anyways, instead of repeating what I've said elsewhere, I'll just drop two links. The Steam announcement includes a more detailed description about the changes, while the IndieDB post describes the development process of the update:
