I have some cool stuff to show this week, so let's get to it!
The biggest gameplay additions this week are the doors. I added doors that fit the jungle and the bunker environments, but I can also easily add more sprite styles in the future. The doors can be locked, and if they are, the player has to activate a switch by either touching it or shooting it to unlock the door. This nicely restricts the level areas, and opens up more possibilities for puzzles. I spent some time making the doors feel as nice as possible, and I think I got that feel nailed down pretty nicely.

Also, to practice video editing and capturing for future needs, I recorded some gameplay footage and compiled it into a video. I wanted the video to show the different environments and color themes of the game, and I think the video turned out quite well. I also added the video to the [Features](#Features) section.
