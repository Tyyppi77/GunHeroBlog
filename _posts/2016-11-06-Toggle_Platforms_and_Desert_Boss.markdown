This week I was able to finish off the desert environment!

First, I added toggle platforms. These platforms become solid and non-solid periodically. I used the platforms in a few interesting patterns to create really cool levels.

After completing all the 24 normal desert levels I got to work on the boss. It took a few days to come up with the boss concept, but once I had that figured out it was mostly just a matter of adding the logic to the boss, and then testing the boss. The boss fight consists of two factors that you need to keep in mind simultaneously: the platforms underneath you disappear in a preset pattern and the boss does sweeps back and forth, so you need to jump over that nasty spike ball.

That's it for this quick weekly update. Next up I want to get to work on the final shorter area of the game, the evil mastermind's base. Thanks for dropping by!
