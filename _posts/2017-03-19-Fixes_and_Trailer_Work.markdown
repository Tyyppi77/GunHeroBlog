Yeahyeah, I missed last week's post. My finals started last week and the week before that I was very focused on studying for them, so I didn't do a whole lot of dev stuff. I didn't do a whole lot this week, but I do have some fixes and patches that I thought I'd list out in the bottom of the post as usual.

I did start to do some preliminary work on a trailer though. I played through the game and I now have recordings of a playthrough that I can use to make some trailer drafts / mockups. I also had this vision of the capsule image replicated at the end of the trailer with cool animations and stuff. So this is what I came up with in a few hours! Pretty cool, isn't it?
