I had a pretty productive week, so I'm really exited about this update! Let's go!
The first gameplay addition I made this week is the case boxes. These boxes hide enemies or prisoners. These add more randomness to the gameplay and add a nice element of surprise to the levels. Here's a gif showing an enemy spawning.

The second gameplay addition is the missile trap I added. These traps detect targets (currently players and prisoners) and shoot missiles if one goes under them. The traps then disable themselves for a moment, allowing the player to trigger them, dodge, and then walk past them.

As a minor tweak, I also made barrels explode when they fall down to the ground or other boxes. This makes box stacks more unstable and barrels more awesome.

Now, onto the thing I most proud of: a small piece of music! That's right, I finally got around and finished and polished a synth riff I composed a while ago. Surely the game will need tons of more music, but it's really nice to get the music thing started too. I also think that this piece will work fine behind a trailer. I really want to get working on that soon. Here's the song, I hope you like it!
