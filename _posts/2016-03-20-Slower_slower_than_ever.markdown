It's Sunday again, and Sunday means that it's time to write another weekly update. I don't have much to show as I was super busy with school work this week, and I will be busy the beginning of the next week too, but then I have a five-day holiday to spend on the game.
The biggest and most awesome new feature this week is the consumable item system: grenades. That's right. You can kill enemies and blow up boxes with grenades now.

I also added loot crates the restore grenades. Currently you start with 5 grenades, and each loot kit restores 4 grenades.

That's pretty much all the visual progress this week. I did a big refactor on the game framework's sound system and I added many new sounds to the game. Most of them are still placeholders that will someday get replaced with better sounding, well, sounds. I also composed a small song. I'm not quite sure if it'll make it to the game though.
Currently I'm fighting with some memory corruption engine-breaking bugs, but hopefully I will get those figured out soon.
As usual, here's the really short change list for this week.
*   Fixed controller devices not getting added
*   Fixed level time showing on finish stats
*   Fixed entities not getting updated in the quadtrees
I might delay the next weekly update to Monday 28th because of the holiday, so I could incorporate also Monday's progress to the update.
Thanks for your interest!
