I have absolutely nothing visual to show from this week. I spent the whole day making sounds with SFXR and adding those to the game. There's still a lot that needs to be added, but the world of the sounds in GunHero is slowly starting to form. I'm really happy with the way it's sounding. I have no idea what the music in GunHero will sound like, but that's something I need to come up with soon.
I've also spent time to fix some more or less critical bugs. That's mostly what the change list is composed of this week. I hope I'll get back to making visual progress next week!
*   Fixed save-menu displaying level filenames
*   Fixed weapons getting stuck on boxes and their owners
*   Fixed parallax layers being awkward on tall levels
*   Fixed join-menu listening to escape keys
*   Fixed explosion damage going trough solid levels
*   Improved the enemy AI
*   Reduced memory usage by not loading particle effects for tile entities
*   Added screenshot functionality to the gif capturer
