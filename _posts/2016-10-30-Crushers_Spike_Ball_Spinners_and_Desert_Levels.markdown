This week I worked on more level elements for the desert environment. I added two new obstacles/traps and made over ten new levels using them.

First, I added vertical crush traps. These blocks detect when the player walks above them and move towards the player with the purpose to crush the player. The movement isn't instant and that's what makes these traps quite devious: you quite easily forget the traps. I made a bunch of cool levels with the crushers. They also act as elevators and path-blockers!

After the crushers I wanted to introduce something a little different. I had this idea of a spinning spike ball on my Trello-board so I decided to give it a go. I really liked the end result so I polished it and made a lot of levels using it. The spinners allow for all kinds of interesting challenges, including timed jumps and these cool patterns that you need to read correctly to get past them.

Next week I'll probably be focusing on making the last six missing desert levels (excluding the boss level) probably using one new obstacle. I hope you had a nice week, and thanks for reading!
